_This repository will leverage a few tools/libraries in order to create AI generated images of flowers_
* Namely we are leveraging
    * PyTorch
    * TensorFlow
    * AWS S3 for hosting our dataset of flower images
    * AWS SageMaker for creating and training our ML models
    * Lambda for serverless scripting and ELT _extract, load, transform_ on our image dataset

## Finally, we will place the generated AI art on an Etherium blockchain standard, minted to be sold as an NFT
